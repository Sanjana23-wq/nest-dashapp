NCT04610437,Intramedullary Resorbable Fixation System Versus K-wire for the Treatment of Lesser Toe Deformities,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04610437,,COMPLETED,"Hammertoe deformity is one of the most common deformities in the foot and is characterized by dorsiflexion of the proximal phalanx at the metatarsal-phalangeal joint and a plantarflexion of the middle phalanx at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Surgical intervention for this type of deformity is indicated when the symptoms progress and conservative treatments are not enough, that is, when we are faced with a rigid painful deformity.Arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint temporarily fixed with a Kirschner wire is the most commonly used techniques.

Therefore, intramedullary fixation with a PLLA needle may be a good alternative. The use of biomaterial is gaining relevance in foot surgery, with polylactic acid being the most widely used due to its strength. Its total biodegradation requires a time of 16-24 months. No cases of foreign body reaction have been described with this type of osteosynthesis material, due to its characteristics similar to those of bone. Its only drawbacks are that it increases the complexity of the technique and that it increases the cost of the procedure. Being a flexible needle, it allows to leave a functional intraoperative claw. It maintains the functionality of the distal interphalangeal joint and carries a lower risk of infection by carrying osteosynthesis material on the outside.

NCT03828578,Comparison of AIRVO High Flow Oxygen Therapy With Standard Care for Prevention of PPCs After Major H&N Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03828578,,COMPLETED,"Patients undergoing major head and neck surgery often develop breathing difficulties as a result of build up of sputum and difficulty taking deep breaths. Often as part of the surgery patients may also require a tracheotomy tube (a temporary tube placed into their airway) which is removed around 5-7 days after the operation. The presence of this tracheostomy tube increases the patient's risk of developing breathing problems, especially difficulty clearing sputum and reduced lung volumes. To reduce the risk of developing these problems, different forms of oxygen therapy and humidification are used. This normally involves using oxygen masks, nebulisers and other medications to help loosen the sputum and maintain blood oxygen levels. Another method of giving oxygen and humidification is through the use of AIRVO, which delivers the air / oxygen to the patient at higher rates as well as warming and humidifying the air.

The aim of this study is to compare the AIRVO system to standard care in a small sample of patients (20 patients) undergoing major head and neck surgery involving insertion of a tracheostomy tube.

Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is used as a cornerstone in the treatment plan of intensive care units (ICUs) patients to provide adequate tissue oxygenation to support the body during the treatment course.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a preventable iatrogenic complication that can develop in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. VAP is pneumonia that develops 2 days after endotracheal intubation; the patient must have new or progressive radiological infiltrate, infection alerts (e.g. fever, white blood cell count change), altered sputum characters, and isolation of a causative organism, all together to diagnose VAP. VAP is the most frequent hospital-acquired infection occurring in the ICUs and has a high associated mortality rate. Mortality rate for VAP ranges from 24-51%.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the VAP preventive effect of the selected EPB and related nurses' education on the incidence and severity of VAP, as well as assess the nurses' compliance with the selected VAP preventive EBP

Hypothesis:

H1: Implementation of VAP prevention EBP and related nurses' education would reduce the incidence of VAP among mechanically ventilated patients compared to those receiving conventional care.

H2: Implementation of VAP prevention EBP and related nurses' education would reduce the severity of VAP among mechanically ventilated patients compared to those receiving conventional care.

Research question:

Q1: What level of compliance do ICU staff have with implementing of VAP prevention EBP?

Trial design The current study will utilize a prospective, longitudinal, single-arm design, pre \& post-experimental. The research's purpose, risks, and potential benefits will be explained to all participants before their voluntary consent and recruitment into the study. Participation was completely voluntary, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their families.

ICU nurses will receive tutorial sessions, including four hours of theory and six hours of clinical training in the clinical setting. The tutorial sessions will cover the proper implementation of ten VAP preventive bundles as an EVB. The clinical training will use a demonstration and redemonstration approach to learning to ensure that they understand and can implement the ten VAP preventive bundles efficiently.

Participants sample and setting The study will be held at the ICU of the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (Imbaba Fever Hospital) (NHTMRI-IFH), Giza, Egypt. The total capacity of the ICUs is 20 beds.

Data collection procedure After obtaining ethical and administrative approval, informed consent will be obtained from eligible patients. The pre-experimental phase will be started by assessing VAP incidence and severity among the participating MV patients using tools 1 and 2, as well as ICU staff compliance to implement the VAP preventive bundle utilizing tool 3 as baseline data for 30-40 days. After finishing the pre-assessment, the following week will be considered washing time before starting the post-experimental time to ensure that all pre-assessment patients are discharged. During the washing time, the nurses will receive a tutorial session on how to implement the adopted VAP preventive bundle, and then the medical and nursing staff will start implementing the VAP preventive bundle in the post-experimental phase for 30-40 days. Tools 1, 2, and 3 will be utilized to evaluate VAP incidence, severity, and ICU staff compliance to implement the VAP preventive bundle. All data will be collected in an Excel sheet for potential statistical analysis.",NO,Evidence-based Practices|Nursing Education|Incidence|Ventilator-associated Pneumonia,OTHER: Ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention Evidence-based practices (VAPPEBP) which consists of ten items bundle,"Evaluate the effect of the selected EPB and related nurses' education on the incidence VAP, VAP incidence will be measured using the diagnostic criteria for clinically defined pneumonia outlined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (TOOL 1) \[3\].

During a patient's stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the SOFA scoring system employs six reproducible variables per organ system to assess the disease's severity. Vincent et al. developed it in 1996 \[9\]. Each organ system was assigned a score between 0 (normal) and 4 (most abnormal), with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 24. We will evaluate the SOFA scores for the patients on ICU admission, the first day of MV connection, every day of VAP development, and on ICU discharge (if applicable)., 35-40 days|Assess the compliance of ICU staff with implementing VAP prevention bundel as an EBP, VAPPCC is an advanced tool formulated by researchers in terms of the proposed VAP prevention EBP (ten bundle).
